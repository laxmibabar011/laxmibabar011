Hey there 👋

I’m Laxmi, a software engineer based in India.

I mostly work on building full stack applications and ERP solutions — turning business requirements into clean, scalable systems. My day-to-day work spans React, Node.js, Python, Odoo, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

Lately, I’ve been spending time learning about Generative AI and Large Language Models, experimenting with how they can integrate into real-world products rather than staying purely theoretical.

This is a space where I’ll be sharing projects, experiments, and things I’m currently exploring. Everything here is built hands-on, with a strong focus on understanding systems end to end.
