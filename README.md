## Hi there 👋

I’m a Software Engineer who enjoys building real-world systems and learning by doing.

I work across full stack development and ERP platforms, focusing on turning business requirements into scalable, reliable software. I’ve worked with technologies like React, Node.js, Python, Odoo, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

🌱 Currently exploring Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and modern backend architectures  
🔭 Building and experimenting with projects that combine web systems, cloud, and AI  
💬 Ask me about full stack development, ERP systems, APIs, and system design  
🚀 Always curious, always learning, always shipping
